# Program Statement: 
To implement UNIX operating system calls fork, exec, getpid, exit, wait, close, stat, opendir and readdir
# Program Description
  Description of `fork`, `exec`, `getpid`, `exit`, `wait`, `close`, `stat`, `opendir`, and `readdir` System Calls

- **`fork()`**: Creates a new process by duplicating the current process, returning `0` to the child and the child’s PID to the parent.  
- **`exec()`**: Replaces the current process image with a new program. Does not return on success.  
- **`getpid()`**: Retrieves the unique process ID of the calling process.  
- **`exit()`**: Terminates a process and releases its resources, returning a status code to the parent.  
- **`wait()`**: Suspends the calling process until a child process terminates, allowing retrieval of the child's exit status.  
- **`close()`**: Closes an open file descriptor to free associated resources.  
- **`stat()`**: Retrieves file or directory metadata, including size, permissions, and timestamps.  
- **`opendir()`**: Opens a directory stream for reading its entries.  
- **`readdir()`**: Reads individual entries from a directory stream, returning their details.  

These system calls are essential for process management, file handling, and directory navigation in UNIX-like operating systems.

# Interpretation of the program

This C program demonstrates the use of several important system calls in a Unix-based operating system. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's actions:

## 1. Creating a Child Process (`fork()`)
- The program starts by creating a **child process** using `fork()`.
- **`fork()`** splits the program into two processes: the **parent process** and the **child process**.

## 2. Child Process
- In the **child process**, the program uses `execlp()` to replace the current process with a new program (`/bin/ls`), which lists the files in the current directory.
- The child process **executes the `ls` command** and shows the contents of the directory.

## 3. Parent Process
- The **parent process** waits for the child process to finish using `wait()`.
- Once the child finishes, the parent continues its work.

## 4. Getting File Information (`stat()`)
- The parent process uses the **`stat()`** function to get information about a file called `example.txt`.
- It then prints the **permissions** (like `rwxr-xr--`) and **file size** of `example.txt`.

## 5. Listing Directory Content (`opendir()` and `readdir()`)
- The parent process then lists the files in the **parent directory** (i.e., `..`) using `opendir()` and `readdir()`.
- These functions open a directory and read its contents, printing the names of the files inside.

## 6. File Operations (Create, Write, Close)
- The parent process **creates a new file** called `testfile.txt` using the **`open()`** system call. If the file doesn't exist, it is created.
- It **writes** a message into the file using the **`write()`** system call.
- Finally, it **closes** the file using `close()`.

## 7. Program Ends
- After completing all tasks, the parent process exits.

## Summary:
- The program demonstrates how to:
  - Create processes with `fork()`.
  - Execute commands using `execlp()`.
  - Fetch file information using `stat()`.
  - List files in directories with `opendir()` and `readdir()`.
  - Perform basic file operations like creating, writing, and closing files.

In short, the program shows how to interact with files and directories in a Unix-like system using system calls.
