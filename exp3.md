> 
> ## 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
>
> * **Core Idea:** Processes are executed in the exact order they arrive in the ready queue (like a line at a ticket
>  counter). The first process that requests the CPU gets it, and it runs to completion (or until it blocks for I/O). Only > > then does the next process in the queue get a chance.
>
> * **Analogy:** Imagine a single line at a bank. Customers are served in the order they joined the line.
> 
> * **Example:** If processes P1, P2, and P3 arrive in that order, P1 will run first, then P2, then P3.
>
> * **Key Characteristics:**
>     * Simple to understand and implement.
>     * Non-preemptive: Once a process starts, it runs until it finishes or blocks.
>     * Can lead to long waiting times for short processes if a long process arrives first (the "convoy effect").
>
> ## 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
> 
> * **Core Idea:** The process with the *shortest* burst time (the estimated time it needs to run on the CPU) is executed
>   next. This aims to minimize average waiting time.
> 
> * **Analogy:** Imagine a doctor's office where patients are seen based on the severity of their condition (shortest  treatment time first).
> 
> * **Example:** If P1 needs 10ms, P2 needs 2ms, and P3 needs 5ms, SJF would run P2 first, then P3, then P1.
> 
> * **Key Characteristics:**
>     * Optimal (non-preemptive): Minimizes average waiting time among non-preemptive algorithms.
>     * Non-preemptive (usually): Once a process starts, it runs to completion.
>     * Requires knowing burst times in advance: This is a major drawback because burst times are often not known precisely. We usually have to estimate them.
>     * Can lead to starvation: Long processes might never get a chance to run if short processes keep arriving.
> 
> ## 3. Round Robin (RR)
> 
> * **Core Idea:** Each process gets a small, fixed amount of CPU time called a "time quantum" or "time slice." If a process doesn't finish within its quantum, it's preempted (temporarily paused) and put back at the end of the ready queue. The CPU then goes to the next process in the queue.
> 
> * **Analogy:** Imagine a group of people taking turns speaking, with each person getting a fixed amount of time to talk before it's someone else's turn.
> 
> * **Example:** If the quantum is 4ms, and P1 needs 10ms, it will run for 4ms, then be preempted. Other processes will get their turn. P1 will then get another 4ms slice when its turn comes around again, and so on.
> 
> * **Key Characteristics:**
>     * Time-sharing: Gives the illusion of concurrency by rapidly switching between processes.
>    * Preemptive: Processes are preempted after their time quantum expires.
>   * Fair: Each process gets a fair share of CPU time.
>    * Good for interactive systems: Provides reasonable response times.
>    * Performance depends on quantum size: A small quantum leads to more context switching overhead, while a large quantum makes RR behave more like FCFS.
>
> ## 4. Priority Scheduling
>
> * **Core Idea:** Each process is assigned a priority. The process with the *highest* priority (often represented by the *smallest* number) is executed first.
>
> * **Analogy:** Imagine a hospital emergency room where patients are treated based on the severity of their injuries (higher priority for more severe cases).
> 
> * **Example:** If P1 has priority 1 (highest), P2 has priority 2, and P3 has priority 3, P1 will run first, then P2, then P3.
>
> * **Key Characteristics:**
>    * Can be preemptive or non-preemptive: A higher-priority process can preempt a lower-priority process (preemptive), or processes can run to completion based on their initial priority (non-preemptive).
 >   * Can lead to starvation: Low-priority processes might never get a chance to run if high-priority processes keep arriving.
>    * Priority inversion: A high-priority process might be blocked by a low-priority process that holds a resource it needs. This can be addressed with techniques like priority inheritance.
> 
> In summary, each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses. The best choice depends on the specific needs of the system, such as whether it's an interactive system, a batch processing system, or a real-time system.

> ## Interpretation of the C CPU Scheduling Simulation Program

> This C program simulates and compares several common CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin.  It aims to demonstrate how each algorithm affects process execution and performance by calculating and displaying waiting times and turnaround times.

> **Program Overview:**

> The program takes process information (PID, burst time, arrival time, priority) as input. The user selects a scheduling algorithm to simulate, and the program calculates and displays performance metrics for each process and their averages.

> **Code Structure and Functionality:**

> 1. **`struct Process`:**
> Defines the structure for process data: `pid`, `burst_time`, `arrival_time`, and `priority`.

> 2. **`compare_burst_time` & `compare_priority`:**
> Comparison functions for `qsort` (from `stdlib.h`) to sort processes by burst time (SJF) and priority (Priority scheduling).

> 3. **`calculate_avg_times`:**
> Calculates and *prints* total and average waiting time and turnaround time, including a header identifying the algorithm.  This function is called by each scheduling algorithm.

> 4. **`fcfs` (First-Come, First-Served):**
> Implements the FCFS algorithm.
> Calculates completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time.
> Handles idle time (when a process arrives after the previous one finishes).
> Calls `calculate_avg_times` to display results.

> 5. **`sjf` (Shortest Job First):**
> Implements SJF.
> Uses `qsort` with `compare_burst_time` to sort processes by burst time.
> Calculates completion, waiting, and turnaround times.
> Handles idle time.
> Calls `calculate_avg_times` to display results.

> 6. **`priority_scheduling`:**
> Implements priority scheduling.
> Uses `qsort` with `compare_priority` to sort processes by priority.
> Effectively uses FCFS on the sorted processes (highest priority first).
> Calls `fcfs` (because the logic is the same after sorting).

> 7. **`round_robin`:**
> Implements Round Robin.
> Uses a `quantum` (time slice).
> Tracks `remaining_bt` (remaining burst time).
> Calculates waiting and turnaround times.
> Handles preemption and queueing.
> Calls `calculate_avg_times` to display results.

> 8. **`main`:**
> Gets the number of processes.
> Takes process details as input.
> Presents a menu to choose a scheduling algorithm.
> Calls the chosen algorithm's function.
> Loops until the user exits.

> **Key Improvements:**

> * **Clearer Output:**
> `calculate_avg_times` handles printing results *and* includes a header identifying the algorithm.
> * **Efficient Sorting:**
> Uses `qsort` for sorting in SJF and Priority.
> * **Idle Time Handling:**
> Correctly handles processes arriving after the previous one finishes.
> * **Negative Wait Time Handling:**
> Sets negative wait times to 0.
> * **Simplified Priority Scheduling:**
> Sorts and then calls `fcfs`.

> This improved version is more robust, efficient, and provides clearer output for comparing CPU scheduling algorithms.

> This C program provides a valuable tool for understanding and comparing the behavior of several fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin. By simulating these algorithms with user-provided process data (PID, burst time, arrival time, and priority), the program calculates and displays key performance metrics, namely waiting time and turnaround time, for each process and their averages.  The clear output, including algorithm-specific headers, facilitates a direct comparison of how each algorithm impacts process execution.

> The program highlights the trade-offs inherent in different scheduling strategies.  FCFS, while simple, can suffer from the convoy effect. SJF, though optimal in terms of average waiting time (for non-preemptive scheduling), requires knowledge of burst times and can lead to starvation. Round Robin offers fairness and responsiveness, particularly for interactive systems, but its performance is sensitive to the chosen time quantum. Priority scheduling allows for prioritizing important tasks but must be carefully managed to avoid starvation or priority inversion.

> The program's improved features, such as the use of `qsort` for efficient sorting, the handling of idle time and negative wait times, and the simplified priority scheduling implementation, enhance its robustness and accuracy.  Ultimately, this simulation provides a practical way to explore the core concepts of CPU scheduling and appreciate the complexities involved in choosing the right algorithm for a given workload and system requirements.  It serves as a useful educational tool for learning about operating system principles.
